# M68000 #

The goal of this project is to simulate a **Motorola M68000** processor

## Details ##

In this early state of the project, I don't know how to realize this goal. I'm a student and we get teached how assembler works since two weeks, so the way of how my simulator works is very unstable and will change very often in future.

There are many differents to a real virtual processor, because for example this processor reads the source file and executes in an interpreted way. The main goal is to write a graphical interface for the simulator to use it for teaching people how programming the m68000 works, not how the processor works 1:1. For example, every processor component could be a sub-class of "Processor" or just a variable and the graphical interface could display every components contents and what it does.
